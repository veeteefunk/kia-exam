                <h2>Cultural behaviour in business</h2> <br>
                <p>Much of today's business is conducted across international borders, 
                    and while the majority of the global business community might share 
                    the use of English as a common language, the nuances and expectations 
                    of business communication might differ greatly from culture to culture. 
                    A lack of understanding of the cultural norms and practices of our 
                    business acquaintances can result in unfair judgements, 
                    misunderstandings and breakdowns in communication. 
                    Here are three basic areas of differences in the business etiquette 
                    around the world that could help stand you in good stead when you next 
                    find yourself working with someone from a different culture.<br>
                   <h3>Addressing someone</h3><br>
                   When discussing this topic in a training course, a German trainee and a British 
                   trainee got into a hot debate about whether it was appropriate for someone with 
                   a doctorate to use the corresponding title on their business card. The British 
                   trainee maintained that anyone who wasn't a medical doctor expecting to be addressed
                    as 'Dr' was disgustingly pompous and full of themselves. The German trainee, however, 
                    argued that the hard work and years of education put into earning that PhD 
                    should give them full rights to expect to be addressed as 'Dr'.<br><br>
                    This stark difference in opinion over something that could be conceived as minor and 
                    thus easily overlooked goes to show that we often attach meaning to even the most 
                    mundane practices. When things that we are used to are done differently, it could spark 
                    the strongest reactions in us. While many Continental Europeans and Latin Americans 
                    prefer to be addressed with a title, for example Mr or Ms and their surname when meeting 
                    someone in a business context for the first time, Americans, and increasingly the British, 
                    now tend to prefer using their first names. The best thing to do is to listen and 
                    observe how your conversation partner addresses you and, if you are still unsure, 
                    do not be afraid to ask them how they would like to be addressed.<br>
                    <h3>Smiling</h3><br>
                    A famous Russian proverb states that 'a smile without reason is a sign of idiocy' and a 
                    so-called 'smile of respect' is seen as insincere and often regarded with suspicion in 
                    Russia. Yet in countries like the United States, Australia and Britain, smiling is often 
                    interpreted as a sign of openness, friendship and respect, and is frequently used to 
                    break the ice.<br><br>
                    In a piece of research done on smiles across cultures, the researchers found that smiling 
                    individuals were considered more intelligent than non-smiling people in countries such as 
                    Germany, Switzerland, China and Malaysia. However, in countries like Russia, Japan, South 
                    Korea and Iran, pictures of smiling faces were rated as less intelligent than the 
                    non-smiling ones. Meanwhile, in countries like India, Argentina and the Maldives, 
                    smiling was associated with dishonesty.<br>
                    <h3>Eye contact</h3><br>
                    An American or British person might be looking their client in the eye to show that they are 
                    paying full attention to what is being said, but if that client is from Japan or Korea, 
                    they might find the direct eye contact awkward or even disrespectful. In parts of South 
                    America and Africa, prolonged eye contact could also be seen as challenging authority. 
                    In the Middle East, eye contact across genders is considered inappropriate, although eye 
                    contact within a gender could signify honesty and truthfulness.<br><br>
                    Having an increased awareness of the possible differences in expectations and behaviour can 
                    help us avoid cases of miscommunication, but it is vital that we also remember that cultural 
                    stereotypes can be detrimental to building good business relationships. Although national 
                    cultures could play a part in shaping the way we behave and think, we are also largely 
                    influenced by the region we come from, the communities we associate with, our age and gender, 
                    our corporate culture and our individual experiences of the world. The knowledge of the potential 
                    differences should therefore be something we keep at the back of our minds, rather than 
                    something that we use to pigeonhole the individuals of an entire nation.</p>
