                <h2>Fairytale of New York</h2> <br>
                <p>Decades after its release, the duet about a couple who have fallen on hard times is still considered by many as one
                    of the greatest christmas songs of all times. <br><br>
                    Once upon a time a band set out to make a Christmas song. Not about snow or sleigh rides or mistletoe or
                    miracles, but lost youth and ruined dreams. A song in which Christmas is as much the problem as it is the
                    solution. A kind of anti-Christmas song that ended up being, for a generation, the Christmas song. <br> <br>
                    That song, Fairytale of New York by the Pogues, has already re-entered the Top 20 every December since 2005,
                    and shows no sign of losing its appeal. It is loved because it feels more emotionally "real" than the homesick
                    sentimentality of White Christmas or the bullish bonhomie of Merry Xmas Everybody, but it contains elements of
                    both and the story it tells is an unreal fantasy of 1940s New York dreamed up in 1980s London. The story of the
                    song is a yarn in itself: how it took more than two years to get right and became, over time, far bigger than the
                    people who made it. As Pogues accordion-player James Fearnley says: "It's like Fairytale of New York went off
                    and inhabited its own planet." <br> <br>
                    Appropriately for a song that pivots on an argument, there is disagreement as to where the idea originated.
                    Fearnley, who recently published a memoir, Here Comes Everybody: The Story of the Pogues, remembers
                    manager Frank Murray suggesting that they cover the Band's 1977 song Christmas Must be Tonight. "It was an
                    awful song. We probably said, forget that, we can do our own."<br><br>
                    Singer Shane MacGowan maintains that Elvis Costello, who produced the Pogues' 1985 masterpiece Rum & the Lash, wagered the singer that he couldn't write a Christmas duet to sing with bass player (and
                    Costello's future wife) Cait O'Riordan. <br><br>
                    Either way, a Christmas song was a good idea. "For a band like the Pogues, very strongly rooted in all kinds of
                    traditions rather than the present, it was a no-brainer," says banjo-player and co-writer Jem Finer. Not to
                    mention the fact that MacGowan was born on Christmas Day 1957. <br><br>
                    The Pogues had formed amid the grimy pubs and bedsits of London's King's Cross in 1982. Although their name
                    and many of their influences were Irish, most of the band
                    weren't, and their interest in folk songs and historical narratives roamed far and wide. They aspired to
                    timelessness</p>
